# Living Documentation

In this chapter you will get familiar with **Pitstop - Garage Management System sample project** and the **LivingDocumentation Analyzer** dotnet tool.

**Prerequisites**  
For this chapter you need the **.NET Core SDK** and **git** installed.

## Getting a *sample project*

To start generating documentation, you need a project with enough code to generate something meaningful.
For this you can use the [Pitstop](https://github.com/EdwinVW/pitstop) project.
This project is created by [Edwin van Wijk](https://github.com/EdwinVW) to showcase several concepts and techniques around DDD and microservices.

### Pitstop - Garage Management System

The solution consist of several services that communicate using a message broker and web api's.

The project gives enough object to start building some documentation.

You will be using a slightly modified version tailored for this workshop.

```sh
❯ git clone "https://github.com/eNeRGy164/pitstop.git"
❯ git checkout "workshop"
```

## The Living Documentation *dotnet tool*

To load the solution and start crawling through all projects, syntax trees and write tree walkers to get a feel for the code would take some time to write.
This process has to be repeated everytime you want to analyze a different solution.
To keep your documentation acurate, it should also be generated as part of you build pipeline.
The performance impact of the compilation step makes you wait for 30-60 seconds everytime you analyze the code.

Considereing these points, the **LivingDocumentation Analyzer** dotnet tool was developed.
It generates an intermediate json file that you generate when the source project changes, but after that you can use it as a source for you documentation renderer.

```sh
❯ dotnet tool install -g LivingDocumentation.Analyzer
```

## Analyzing the Pitstop *Solution*

```sh
❯ livingdoc-analyze --solution "pitstop.sln" --output "pitstop.analyzed.json"
```

This can take about 30-60 seconds.

```text
Living Documentation Analysis output generated in 31346ms at pitstop.analyzed.json
```

The json file will contain an array of all classes, methods, variables, types, if/else/case statements, etc...

*If you want to inspect the json structure, add the `--pretty` switch to the command.*

*If there are issues like missing classes or unexpected output, add the `--verbose` switch to the command to see compile errors and other warnings.*

## Solution

You can find a prettyfied version of the output with the [LivingDocumentation solution](solutions/21.LivingDocumentation/).
